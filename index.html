      <h1>Remembering Aaron Wernimont</h1>
      <h2>My family would like to thank you all for coming.  The tremendous support, kind words and comfort have really been overwhelming.  The sheer number of people in attendance here today is a testament to how special Aaron was, how many lives he touched, and the loving and supportive community we are blessed to be a part of.  You have lifted us up in this difficult time.</h2>

        <p>As I was driving to Pocahontas to be with my family I had some time to think about what good could come of this and what Aaron would want us to focus on.   My brother’s death is a reminder of how delicate and fleeting life can be and that we are not guaranteed tomorrow.  Aaron was an example of living life to the fullest that we can all emulate.  I think he would want us to renew our resolve to live life everyday as if it could be our last.  Let us be reminded to take nothing for granted and most importantly appreciate and value the people in our lives that matter the most and to let them know it.  By doing so we honor Aaron. </p>
        <p>To Kahri, Aaron loved you wholeheartedly and was never afraid to express that.  As an older brother, I learned a lot about selfless love from watching him with you.  As was always true of Aaron, there were no pretenses or games, just genuine love.  Although your time with him was cut short, you can be comforted in knowing that you found a love that some search for their entire lives and never attain.  You will forever be a part of our family, and when Aaron married you I gained another sister.  One I could actually stand…<p>
        <p>To my family, we will endure…  We will again be together and laugh as we have in the past and the joy we have when we are together will return.  Aaron would want it that way.   Family is the most important thing in life.  We have been blessed with an amazing, some would say crazy, family and we often take it for granted.  For this I apologize and promise to try to be more like Aaron by being more appreciative of my family and let them know it.  Yesterday while at the family viewing Father Kolasch was there and as we were about to leave said something that may help us make sense of all this.  He said events like this make people holy or make them mean.  I found that very interesting and after some thought tried to see how that might be applied to this situation.  We are all trying to make sense of this tragic event, it will never be clear, only God understands why these things happen.  But we may find solace in this insightful comment…  Events like this make you holy or make you mean…  I know I am going to strive to be more holy and to live like I know Aaron would have wanted me to and I suspect there are others who feel the same way and therefore through Aaron’s death some of us may find everlasting life.</p>
        <p class="closing">To know Aaron was to love him.</p>
        <p class="poem">
        I’d like to end with a poem:</br>
        Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep.</br>
        I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glint on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain.</br>
        When you wake in the morning hush, I am the swift, uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circling flight. I am the soft starlight at night.</br>
        Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep.</br>
        Aaron thank you for being part of our lives. We are all going to miss you.</p>
